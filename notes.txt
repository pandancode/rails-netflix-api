--> WAY TO READ THE HEADERS SENT FROM CLIENT
request.headers["Authorization"]


--> READ THE CONTENT OF THE BODY SEND FROM CLIENT
request.raw_post


--> TO READ JSON SENT FROM CLIENT SIDE:
* Require json inside and at the top of the controller, then execute below:
* res_body = JSON.parse(request.raw_post)


--> TO READ INFORMATION PASSED DIRECTLY INSIDE THE API URL PASSED FROM CLIENT:
* Example with this "DELETE" request:
    fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/v1/favorites/${movie_id}`, {method: "DELETE})
* We can read the "movie_id" value in rails as is: params["id"]


--> SEND DATA TO CLIENT AS JSON
* WHEN SENDING DATA BACK TO THE CLIENT, ALWAYS TRANSFORM IT ONTO JSON
* When sending data to the client, always transform it onto json first as demonstrated below:
* favorite_list.to_json
* Make sure to require "json" inside and at the top of the controller

* To read the data fronm the client side do:
  - Return the response as is: rreturn res.json()
  - Then to be able tor read it, make sure to use:
      JSON.parse(data) to be able tor ead it
